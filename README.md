# cs_210_project_three

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.


What did you do particularly well?

The code is efficient and clear to understand.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

My menu has a line of code that is quite wide and could be broken into 2 lines. I used an absolute path to open files so this will not be reproducible on other systems.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I got stuck creating the histogram and writing to the file for a bit. I tried to apply function/syntax that was not applicable for a file.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I gained a better understanding of how to use multiple languages in one program and the pros/cons of such. I also gained better knowledge of C++ unique strengths.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Good clean formatting/spacing, proper syntax, use of comments, and code that is not overly redundant or lengthy. Using loops and efficent functions.
